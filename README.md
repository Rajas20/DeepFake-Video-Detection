# DeepFake Video Detection

A Deep Learning-based system for detecting deepfake videos using facial region preprocessing and a CNN + LSTM architecture.

This project involves extracting facial frames from videos, preprocessing them into a standardized format, and then feeding them into a deep learning model to detect whether a video is real or fake.

##  Features

-  Extracts frames from videos
-  Detects and crops faces using `face_recognition`
-  Converts faces into standardized `112x112` videos
-  Ready for training on CNN + LSTM for temporal analysis
-  Modular design for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
